This project aims to predict price movement of a designated stock during a fixed time frame using neural
network models. The motivation comes from the increasing usage of electronic-trading platform in
day-to-day trading activities, whereas the automation of movement of mid-price and price spread crossing
becomes an essential part of every-day trading mechanism. By characterising the existing features in
given dataset and creating new statistical features such as moving averages, we applied feed forward
neural network (FFNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) on
training dataset and tested on validation dataset. After a comparison and discussion of the accuracies and
losses of all three models, we reach to a conclusion that FFNN model works the best, with a training
accuracy at 0.531 and test accuracy at 0.5, as well as a training loss level at 1.038 and test loss level at
1.04.
